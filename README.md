This is the code for a doorbell using a Raspberry Pi 3B+ having a camera, box and microphone and KAKU-sender.
So far the doorbell is able to, when rang, sound the bell, take a picture, send an email, tweet and sms, trigger Homey (home automation device)

Still working on adding other applications. Most wanted is being able to make a phonecall.

See 'Doorbell description.odt' for a more elaborate manual.
